# Let's analyze the token structure:
# - The first 15 characters are known for both tokens
# - The remaining 17 characters are the redeem code

# Since ECB mode encrypts blocks of 16 bytes:
# Block 1: Characters 0-15 (we know these for both tokens)
# Block 2: Characters 16-31 (contains the redeem code)

# We need to find a way to construct a valid redeem code for the target token

# First, let's try generating different access tokens with different redeem codes
# to see if we can manipulate the encrypted output in a predictable manner

    # First character of redeem is at position 15, which is the last byte of block 0
    # The remaining 16 characters are in block 1

    # This is where ECB's vulnerability comes in:
    # If we can find a way to make the plaintext blocks align,
    # we can use our known redeem code to derive the unknown one

    # For simplicity, let's try a direct approach
    # The ECB vulnerability means we can potentially use parts of our known encryption
    # to craft a valid new token by swapping blocks

    # Let's try to construct a redeem code that would result in a valid token
    # for the target note

    # Given that the redeem code is 17 digits, it spans across blocks:
    # - Last byte of block 0: first digit
    # - All of block 1: remaining 16 digits

    # The difference in prefixes causes misalignment:
    # your_prefix = "g5Jvt3H10102030" (15 chars)
    # target_prefix = "theflag18042025" (15 chars)

    # Since both prefixes are the same length (15 chars), we're in luck!
    # The redeem code alignment is the same for both tokens.

    # Extract the redeem code - this is a simple approach
    # The key insight: if we use a modified redeem code with the target prefix,
    # we should get a correctly encrypted token for the target

    # Here's a quick approach:
    # Use the difference between the target and your token to find the redeem code

    # Since we know that both tokens have the same structure:
    # - Block 0: prefix + first digit of redeem
    # - Block 1: remaining 16 digits of redeem

    # And we know your_redeem, we can deduce the target_redeem

    # This is a simplified approach that works because:
    # 1. Both prefixes are the same length (15 chars)
    # 2. The redeem code spans blocks in the same way for both tokens
    # 3. ECB mode encrypts each block independently
